# Proof the 4D Hypdercube is a Complete Dimension-descending Tiler

For centuries, man has known all eleven of the cube's unfoldings tile space.

In 2015, G. Diaz and J. O'Rourke proved the first case of a hypercube face-unfolding's edge-unfolding tiling the plane. Through a brute force search, I show this is true for all of the hypercube's unfoldings. Mkaing it a dimension-descending tiler!

The proof was presented at the Japan Conference on Discrete and Computational Geometry, Graphs, and Games [JCDCG³ 2022 Proceedings, p. 100](https://www.rs.tus.ac.jp/jcdcggg/JCDCG3-2022Proceedings(r2).pdf)

Each unfolding follows the numbering system established by [FU Berlin Mathematics](https://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/moritz/mo/198722/unfoldings)
